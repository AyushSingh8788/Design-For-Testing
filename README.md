# Design-For-Testing
Welcome to my DFT (Design-for-Testability or Design-for-Test) portfolio repository! This repository showcases my practical projects and exercises in DFT, focusing on RTL (Register Transfer Level) implementations of essential techniques such as Scan Chain and Built-In Self-Test (BIST).

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my technical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and passion for RTL Design and DFT. It also serves as a resource for learning and exploring key concepts in DFT.
